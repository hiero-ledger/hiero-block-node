/**
 * This plugin is responsible for providing the "Files Recent" block provider. This stores incoming blocks in files in
 * the local filesystem. It stores block items as soon as they are received into a temporary file until the ends of the
 * block. The temporary file is stored in unverified path. Once the block is verified, it is moved to the live path.
 * This plugin assumes that it stores blocks forever until asked to delete them.
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 * There are three threading interactions for this class. Any shared state between the three interactions needs to be
 * considered multithreaded, so handled with thread safe data structures.
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>BlockProviderPlugin methods</b> - The init() and start() methods are called at startup only and only ever
 *     by one thread at a time and before any listeners are called. The reading methods block() and latestBlockNumber()
 *     need to be handled in a thread safe way. As they can be called on any thread. So any state accessed needs to be
 *     final or thread safe data structures.</li>
 *     <li><b>BlockNotificationHandler methods</b> - These are always called on the same single dedicated thread for
 *     this handler.</li>
 *     <li><b>BlockItemHandler methods</b> - These are always called on the same single dedicated thread for this
 *     handler.It should do all work on that thread and block it till work is done. By doing that it will provide back
 *     pressure into the messaging system. This is important as it stops the messaging system running ahead of the
 *     plugin resulting in missing block item chucks. If this plugin can not keep up with the incoming block items rate,
 *     the messaging system will provide back pressure through the provider to the consensus nodes pushing block items
 *     to the block node.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h2>Unverified Blocks</h2>
 * The storage of unverified blocks is done in a configured directory. That directory can be in temporary storage as it
 * is not required to be persistent. On start-up, the plugin will delete any files in the unverified directory. This is
 * done to clean up any files that are left over from a previous run. The unverified directory does not have any special
 * subdirectory structure and blocks are just stored as individual files directly in that directory. This is fine as
 * there should never be more than a few unverified blocks at a time. The unverified blocks are stored in a compressed
 * format so they are ready to just be moved to the live directory when they are verified. The compression type is
 * configured and can be changed at any time. The compression level is also configured and can be changed at any time.
