/**
 * This class is used to represent a session for a single BlockStream subscriber that has connected to the block node.
 * At least to start with we will only support receiving a single SubscribeStreamRequest per session.
 * <p>
 * This session supports two primary modes of operation: live-streaming and historical streaming. Also switching between
 * on demand as needed.<p>
 * #### Threading<br/>
 * This class is called from many threads from web server, the block messaging system and its own background historical
 * fetching thread. To make its state thread safe it uses synchronized methods around all entry points from other
 * threads (which are minimized to avoid potential for deadlock or contention). Currently only the close method is
 * synchronized.<p>
 * #### Request Validity<br/>
 * The request is validated when the session starts, if it is invalid, the session is closed immediately with an
 * appropriate error code.<br/>
 * A valid request is one where:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The request start and end are both equal to -1L: request is for livestream, wherever it may be.</li>
 *     <li>The request start is -1L, and the end is greater or equal to 0L: request is for all blocks from the first available up to and including the end block.</li>
 *     <li>The request start is greater or equal to 0L, and the end is -1L: request is for all blocks from the start block onwards indefinitely.</li>
 *     <li>The request start is greater or equal to 0L, and the end is greater or equal to start: request is for all blocks from the start block up to and including the end block.</li>
 * </ul>
 * #### Fulfilling the Request<br/>
 * After validating the request, the session determines if it can fulfill the request. If it cannot, it closes
 * immediately with an appropriate error code.<br/>
 * In most cases, we need to know which is the first available block (this means a block that the node can provide
 * historically) and also the latest known block (the latest block the node can provide, be that from history, or
 * available in the live stream).<br/>
 * The first available block is needed mostly because we need to have a reference point as to what we can supply,
 * because if a request starts with block 10 for instance, and we have no blocks historically available, we cannot
 * determine if the first block available will be less than or equal to 10, thus we cannot determine if we can
 * fulfill the request. Such cases should be very rare.<br/>
 * The latest known block is mostly needed because a request might be with a start of a future block. This means that
 * the block node does not yet have the block available, be that in history or live stream. A request that is too far
 * into the future cannot be fulfilled.<br/>
 * A request can be fulfilled if:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The request is for live blocks (start and end equal to -1L). This can always be fulfilled.</li>
 *     <li>The request is for start of -1L (first available), and end greater or equal to 0L, and the first available block is less than or equal to end.</li>
 *     <li>The request is for start greater or equal to 0L, and end equal to -1L, and the first available block is less than or equal to start, and start is within the permitted future range.</li>
 *     <li>The request is for start greater or equal to 0L, and end greater or equal to start, and the first available block is less than or equal to start, and start is within the permitted future range.</li>
 * </ul>
