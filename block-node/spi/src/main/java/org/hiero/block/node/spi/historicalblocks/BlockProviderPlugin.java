/**
 * The BlockProviderPlugin interface is implemented by plugins that provide access to historical blocks. The plugin then
 * exposes the BlockProviderPlugin through the Java ServiceLoader. Each plugin provides a name and a default priority.
 * They are sorted by priority, with the highest priority first. System config can be used to chose list of plugins to
 * use and override their default priorities.
 * <p>
 * Some examples of plugins that could be implemented are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>RAM cache</li>
 *     <li>File system</li>
 *     <li>S3 style cloud storage</li>
 *     <li>Other block nodes</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * BlockProviderPlugins are responsible for acquiring the blocks themselves. They can get them either from
 * {@link BlockMessagingFacility} by listening in incoming new blocks or
 * by reading from other BlockProviderPlugins via the {@link HistoricalBlockFacility}. They can collect blocks and
 * store them at their own pace. They may choose to provide some, all or node of the blocks the collect back to
 * requesters.
