/**
 * The BlockNodeContext record is used to provide access to the different facilities of the block node. This is a
 * standard global context that provides default facilities to all plugins.
 * <p><b><i>
 * Important this interface will want to grow, that urge should be fought against. The goal is to keep this interface
 * small and simple. If you need to add a new method, you will need to APOLOGIZE to the all other developers first :-)
 * </i></b></p>
 * <p>
 * The reason this exists and is an interface rather than passing each of the facilities into the plugin
 * {@link BlockNodePlugin#init(BlockNodeContext, ServiceBuilder)} method is to allow future additions without breaking all existing
 * plugins by changing the start method signature. Or ending up with multiple versioned start methods with different
 * signatures. It is aiming for the best balance between allowing future expansion, avoiding growth into a mess and
 * keeping the API clean.
