/**
 * A very simple executor to be used only for testing! This executor has the
 * ability to block the caller and execute tasks until completion either
 * on the caller thread, or on a single thread per task. It will
 * collect all submitted tasks to it and will hold them in order. After that
 * when the {@link #executeSerially()} method is called, all tasks will be
 * executed in order serially on the same thread that called the method. This
 * will ensure that all tasks will complete before doing any asserts. This pool
 * can also execute tasks asynchronously using any of the
 * {@link #executeAsync()} methods. The tasks will be executed in the
 * order they were submitted to the pool, and will be executed using a
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPerTaskExecutor} internally. There are
 * options to join the tasks, effectively blocking until all tasks are completed.
