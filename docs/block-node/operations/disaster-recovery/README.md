# Block Node Disaster Recovery Playbooks

Operational runbooks for recovering from Block Node failure scenarios. Each playbook covers a single scenario: how to confirm you are in it, how to recover, and how to verify recovery is complete.

**Use these playbooks when something has already gone wrong.** For planned maintenance, upgrades, and non-emergency procedures, see the [Block Node documentation](../../README.md).

**These playbooks live on GitHub only and are not published to GitBook.** They contain operational commands, internal escalation paths, and environment-specific placeholders not suitable for public documentation.

## Find your playbook

Match what you are seeing to a playbook. If you are not sure, open the closest match and let the **"Is this your doc?"** section at the top confirm or redirect you.

**Severity:** SEV-1 = transactions halted or data integrity at risk · SEV-2 = degraded redundancy, no transaction halt · SEV-3 = downstream consumers affected, consensus unaffected

## Adding a new playbook

1. Copy [`_template.md`](./_template.md) and name the new file `NN-short-scenario-name.md`.
2. Fill in every section. Do not leave placeholder text in a committed file.
3. Add a row to the "Find your playbook" table and the full index in this README.
4. Open a PR - these playbooks do not go through the GitBook `SUMMARY.md` flow.
