## Summary

This document describes the metrics that are available in the system, its purpose, and how to use them.

**App level metric name prefix:** `hiero_block_node`

These metrics expose **operational health, data‑integrity, and storage growth** for every stage of a Hiero Block Node (BN).
They are scraped by Prometheus with the **standard pull model**:

## Purpose

The purpose of metrics is to provide a way to measure the performance of the system. Metrics are used to monitor the system and to detect any issues that may arise. Metrics can be used to identify bottlenecks, track the performance of the system over time, and to help diagnose problems.

## Configuration

### Prometheus

Prefix: prometheus, ie. `prometheus.configKey`

| ConfigKey                 | Description                                                                           | Default |
|:--------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------:|
| enableEndpoint            | either `true` or `false`. Enables or disables the endpoint for metrics                |    true |
| endpointPortNumber        | Port of the Prometheus endpoint                                                       |   16007 |
| endpointMaxBacklogAllowed | The maximum number of incoming TCP connections which the system will queue internally |       1 |

## How to Access Metrics

```
http://<host>:16007/metrics
```

* Default port `16007`.
* Output is plain‑text in Prometheus exposition format (`# HELP`, `# TYPE`, `<metric> <value>`).

Example `scrape_configs` snippet:

        scrape_configs:
          - job_name: hiero-block-node
            static_configs:
              - targets: ['bn‑01.example.com:16007']   # change port if customised
