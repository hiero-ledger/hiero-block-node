# `Stream Subscriber Plugin` Test Plan

## Overview

The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` allows clients to subscribe (issue a request for
gRPC server streaming) to a Block Node and receive a stream of Blocks based on
the specified request criteria.

Blocks could be streamed from the Block Node's history and/or from the live
Block Stream as new Blocks are being published to the Block Node.

## Key Considerations

- **SubscriberServicePlugin**: The plugin accepts gRPC requests from clients
  and then opens a `BlockStreamSubscriberSession` for each request. Each session
  runs on its own thread.
- **BlockStreamSubscriberSession**: Each session handles a single gRPC
  request from a client on a dedicated thread. The session supplies the Blocks
  to the client based on the request criteria. Blocks can be supplied from
  history and/or from the live Block Stream, depending on where the next Block
  to be sent to the client is located. Going to history and live is
  interchangeable.
- **Request Parameters**: A request specifies start and end Block numbers, both
  inclusive. Both start and end must be whole numbers, as only whole numbers
  are valid Block numbers. It is possible, however, to also specify -1L
  (signed long) to both or any of start and end. Note that the gRPC spec uses
  `uint64` for both values, so `uint64_max` (`0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`) is the
  equivalent of -1L signed long. A start of -1L means "start from first
  available Block", while an end of -1L means "stream indefinitely". When both
  start and end are specified as -1L, it means that the request is for the next
  complete live Block, whichever it may be, and then continue to stream
  indefinitely.
- **Request Validation**: Each request is validated to ensure that the
  specified criteria are valid.
- **Request Fulfillment Precheck**: After a request is validated, a
  precheck is performed to ensure that the request can be fulfilled. A request
  that is valid might not be fulfillable at the moment.
- **Future Requests**: It is possible to subscribe to Blocks that are not yet
  available in the Block Node. This only applies when the request has specified
  a start Block. A future request is one where the start Block is greater than
  the highest Block number currently available to be supplied by the Block Node,
  be that from history or the live stream. In that case, a check is made if the
  request is too far into the future. The last permitted start is a value that
  is calculated by adding a configured maximum future offset to the highest
  Block number currently available. If the start Block is greater than that
  value, the request is considered too far into the future and is rejected as
  unfulfillable. If the request is not too far into the future, the session
  will essentially _wait_ until the start Block becomes available, at which
  point the session will start streaming the Blocks to the client.
- **End Block**: After each block is streamed in full to the client, an
  EndBlock message is sent to the client to indicate that the Block has been
  fully sent.

> **Please note**: unless otherwise specified, all tests assume that no Blocks

> with whether Blocks are coming from history or live, as long as the Blocks are
> being streamed according to the request criteria. Simply, the client has
> subscribed for the stream and as long as the Block Node is able to provide the
> Blocks according to the request criteria, the client should be receiving them.

### Positive Request Validation Tests

> **Please note**: the positive request validation tests also cover positive
> and negative fulfillment precheck scenarios, as they are closely related and
> in order to assert the positive request validation, the fulfillment precheck
> must also be asserted because streaming or any other response can only happen
> if the request is valid and the fulfillment precheck is executed, be that
> the result thereof is positive or negative. When a request is valid, but the
> fulfillment precheck is negative, the request is rejected as unfulfillable and
> we expect a certain response to be sent to the client.

##### Test Name

`Verify Invalid Request: Invalid End Block`

##### Scenario Description

`Stream Subscriber Plugin` accepts gRPC server streaming requests. If the
request is invalid, the request will be rejected and an appropriate error
message will be sent to the client. The connection will also be closed.

##### Requirements

The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST allow clients to send gRPC requests.</br>
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST validate the gRPC requests.</br>
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST reject invalid requests and send an
appropriate error message to the client.

##### Expected Behaviour

- It is expected that when a client sends an invalid gRPC request with an
  invalid end Block (blockNumber lower than -1L),
  the `Stream Subscriber Plugin` will validate the request, determine that it is
  invalid, and then reject the request by sending the INVALID_END_BLOCK_NUMBER
  code to the client.
- It is expected that the connection will be closed.

##### Preconditions

- A Block Node with:
  - A working `Stream Subscriber Plugin`.
- A Subscriber Client that can send gRPC server streaming requests to the Block
  Node and receive responses.

##### Input

- A Subscriber Client sends an invalid gRPC request with an invalid end Block
  (blockNumber lower than -1L).

##### Output

- The Subscriber Client receives the INVALID_END_BLOCK_NUMBER error code
  indicating that the request was invalid.
- The connection is closed.

##### Test Name

`Verify Invalid Request: Invalid Closed Range`

##### Scenario Description

`Stream Subscriber Plugin` accepts gRPC server streaming requests. If the
request is invalid, the request will be rejected and an appropriate error
message will be sent to the client. The connection will also be closed.

##### Requirements

The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST allow clients to send gRPC requests.</br>
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST validate the gRPC requests.</br>
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST reject invalid requests and send an
appropriate error message to the client.

##### Expected Behaviour

- It is expected that when a client sends an invalid gRPC request with a closed
  range - both start and end are whole numbers, but end is greater than start,
  the `Stream Subscriber Plugin` will validate the request, determine that it is
  invalid, and then reject the request by sending the INVALID_END_BLOCK_NUMBER
  code to the client.
- It is expected that the connection will be closed.

##### Preconditions

- A Block Node with:
  - A working `Stream Subscriber Plugin`.
- A Subscriber Client that can send gRPC server streaming requests to the Block
  Node and receive responses.

##### Input

- A Subscriber Client sends an invalid gRPC request with a closed range - both
  start and end are whole numbers, but end is greater than start.

##### Output

- The Subscriber Client receives the INVALID_END_BLOCK_NUMBER error code
  indicating that the request was invalid.
- The connection is closed.

### Error Tests

#### TC-ERR-001

##### Test Name

`Verify Abrupt Client Connection Termination`

##### Scenario Description

`Stream Subscriber Plugin` accepts gRPC server streaming requests. If the
client abruptly terminates the connection, the session handling the request
must handle the termination gracefully without causing any resource leaks or
other issues. The session must be cleaned up properly. Such abrupt termination
could happen at any time, be that while the request is being validated, during
the fulfillment precheck, while streaming Blocks to the client, or while waiting
for the next Block to become available. In no case must the abrupt termination
cause the `Stream Subscriber Plugin` or the Block Node to become unstable.

##### Requirements

The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST allow clients to send gRPC requests.</br>
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST validate the gRPC requests.</br>
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST perform a precheck to ensure that the
request can be fulfilled.</br>
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST start streaming the Blocks to the client
based on the request criteria if the request is valid and can be fulfilled.
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST send an EndBlock message to the client after
streaming a Block in full, for every Block streamed.</br>
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST handle abrupt client connection termination
gracefully without causing any resource leaks or other issues.</br>
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST clean up the session properly after an
abrupt client connection termination.</br>
The `Stream Subscriber Plugin` MUST remain stable after an abrupt client
connection termination.

##### Expected Behaviour

- It is expected that when a client sends any valid gRPC request, the
  `Stream Subscriber Plugin` will validate the request, perform a fulfillment
  precheck, and then start streaming the Blocks to the client based on the
  request criteria, granted that the request is valid and fulfillable.
- It is expected that if the client abruptly terminates the connection at any
  point in time, the session handling the request will handle the termination
  gracefully without causing any resource leaks or other issues. The session
  will be cleaned up properly.
- It is expected that the `Stream Subscriber Plugin` and the Block Node will
  remain stable after the abrupt client connection termination.

##### Preconditions

- A Block Node with:
  - A working `Stream Subscriber Plugin`.
  - A working Publisher component that will be publishing new Blocks to the
    Block Node which will then be available for streaming to clients.
  - A working Block Provision component that will have the ability to
    provision historical Blocks if needed.
- A Subscriber Client that can send gRPC server streaming requests to the Block
  Node and receive responses.
  - The Subscriber Client has the ability to abruptly terminate the connection
    at any point in time.

##### Input

- A Publisher component starts publishing new Blocks to the Block Node starting
  from Block `0000000000000000000` onwards.
- A Subscriber Client sends a valid gRPC request for live Blocks.
- The Subscriber Client abruptly terminates the connection at various points
  in time:
  - While the request is being validated.
  - During the fulfillment precheck.
  - While streaming Blocks to the client.
  - While waiting for the next Block to become available.
