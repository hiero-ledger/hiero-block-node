# `Stream Publisher Plugin` Test Plan

## Overview

The `Stream Publisher Plugin` is an essential part of the Block Node.

The plugin enables publishers of the Block Stream to connect and publish
the Block Stream to the Block Node.

The plugin allows for multiple publishers to stream simultaneously to the Block
Node. A gRPC bidirectional stream is established between the publisher and the
Block Node on connect. This allows not only for the publisher to publish the
Block Stream, but also for the Block Node to send responses back to the
publisher.

This E2E test plan is designed to highlight the key scenarios that need to be
tested for end results in order to ensure the correctness and proper working of
the `Stream Publisher Plugin`. Essentially, this test plan describes the
intended behavior of the `Stream Publisher Plugin` and the expected results it
produces.

## Key Considerations

- **Protocol**: The plugin complies with and implements the
  [publishBlockStream protocol](../../design/communication-protocol/publish-block-stream.md).
- **Internal Communication**: Internally, the plugin relies on verification and
  persistence notifications in order to determine the responses it will send to
  publishers that are connected.
- **Publisher Handler**: For each connected publisher, the plugin will create a
  new, dedicated Publisher Handler. Each handler is responsible for receiving
  requests from the publisher it handles and to send responses to the same
  publisher.
- **Publisher Manager**: All handlers exchange messages with the Publisher
  Manager, which is responsible for coordinating all handlers by sending them
  actions the handler must perform. The Publisher Manager is also responsible
  for propagating the Block Stream to the Block Node's internal messaging
  system in block order (a monotonously incrementing sequence of block number,
  i.e. `long`). The manager follows it's internal state and is able to react to
  unfavorable events, such as a failed verification of a block, or a handler
  that disconnects abruptly, to name a few. The manager then determines what
  responses should be sent (if any) to publishers via their handlers (if any),
  what actions the handlers must perform or if to end the bidi stream/s.
- **Acknowledgements**: When a block is successfully verified and persisted,
  the plugin will send an acknowledgement to all connected publishers for that
  block, or for a block with a higher number. When an acknowledgement is
  received by a publisher, the publisher can then safely assume that all blocks
  up to and including the acknowledged block have been successfully verified
  and persisted.

##### Test Name

`Verify Multi Publisher Skip`

##### Scenario Description

`Stream Publisher Plugin` will allow publishers to connect and publish the
Block Stream to the Block Node. When a Block is currently being streamed or is
already streamed in full, but still being processed (not acknowledged yet), the
plugin will respond with the SKIP message to any other publisher that attempts
to publish a Block with the same number as the Block currently being streamed or
processed.

The publisher that is currently streaming a Block can send subsequent
requests that consist of items, which are part of the Block it is currently
streaming. The plugin will then simply keep accepting those items.

##### Requirements

The `Stream Publisher Plugin` MUST allow publishers to connect.<br/>
The `Stream Publisher Plugin` MUST accept valid Blocks streamed by
publishers.<br/>
The `Stream Publisher Plugin` MUST send acknowledgements to all publishers
when a received Block is successfully verified and persisted.<br/>
The `Stream Publisher Plugin` MUST respond with a SKIP message to any
publisher that attempts to publish a Block with the same number as a Block
that is currently being streamed or is already streamed in full, but still
being processed (not acknowledged yet).<br/>

##### Expected Behaviour

- It is expected that when multiple publishers connect to a Block Node and one
  publisher is streaming valid Blocks, any other publisher that attempts to
  stream a Block with the same number as the Block currently being streamed or
  processed will receive a SKIP message in response.

##### Preconditions

- A Block Node with:
  - A working `Stream Publisher Plugin`.
  - A working Block Verification component which includes sending
    Verification Notifications with verification results.
  - A working Block Persistence component which includes sending
    Persistence Notifications with persistence results.
- Multiple Publishers (A, B and C) that are able to connect and stream valid
  Blocks to the Block Node.

##### Input

- Publisher A, B and C connect to the Block Node. Publisher A starts streaming
  valid Block `0000000000000000000`. While Publisher A is still streaming the
  Block, Publisher B and C attempt to stream the same Block
  `0000000000000000000`.

##### Output

- Publishers B and C receive a SKIP message in response to their
  attempt to stream Block `0000000000000000000`.

##### Test Name

`Verify Multi Publisher Duplicate Block`

##### Scenario Description

`Stream Publisher Plugin` will allow publishers to connect and publish the
Block Stream to the Block Node. When a Block is already acknowledged, meaning it
has been successfully verified and persisted, the plugin will respond with an
EndOfStream with the DUPLICATE_BLOCK code to any other publisher that attempts
to publish the same Block again. The connection with the publisher that sent
the duplicate Block will then be closed.

##### Requirements

The `Stream Publisher Plugin` MUST allow publishers to connect.<br/>

publishers.<br/>
The `Stream Publisher Plugin` MUST send acknowledgements to all publishers
when a received Block is successfully verified and persisted.<br/>

that sent the duplicate Block.<br/>

##### Expected Behaviour

- It is expected that when multiple publishers connect to a Block Node
  and a publisher publishes a valid block that gets acknowledged, meaning it
  has been successfully verified and persisted, any other publisher that
  attempts to stream the same Block again will receive an EndOfStream with the
  DUPLICATE_BLOCK code in response and the connection with that publisher will
  be closed.

##### Preconditions

- A Block Node with:
  - A working `Stream Publisher Plugin`.

  Blocks to the Block Node.

##### Input

- Publisher A and B connect to the Block Node. Publisher A streams valid Block
  `0000000000000000000` which gets acknowledged. Publisher B then attempts to
  stream the same Block `0000000000000000000`.

##### Output

  response to its attempt to stream Block `0000000000000000000` and the
