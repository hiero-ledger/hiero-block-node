# E2E Test Plan - `Files Recent Persistence`

## Overview

Persistence is a key component of the Block-Node. We need to ensure that we have
good and reliable persistence plugins that can be used by the Block-Node. We
support local file system persistence for recently received and verified blocks
which we call `Files Recent Persistence`. Also, complementary to the persistence
capability itself, we have the ability to retrieve (read) blocks that have been
persisted. `Block Provision` is another key component of the Block-Node.
The `Files Recent Persistence` is however an optional component, meaning that
the system is able to operate without it present and loaded.

This E2E test plan is designed to highlight the key scenarios that need to be
tested for end results in order to ensure the correctness and proper working of
the `Files Recent Persistence` as well as the complementary `Block Provision`
logic. Essentially, this test plan describes the intended behavior of the
`Files Recent Persistence` and the expected results it produces.

## Key Considerations for `Files Recent Persistence`

- **Path Resolution Logic**: `Files Recent Persistence` relies on path
  resolution logic which determines the location of a given block.
- **Trie Data Structure for Path Resolution**: `Files Recent Persistence`
  utilizes a trie data structure to resolve paths for blocks. This is done to
  ensure that the blocks are stored in a structured manner, allowing for
  efficient storage and retrieval. The trie structure is based on the digits of
  the blockNumber, with each directory (tree node) representing the next 3
  digits of the whole blockNumber, going left to right.
- **Files Recent Root Path**: This is the root path (configurable) where all
  blocks that have passed verification are stored. Generally, the stored blocks
  are relatively short-lived because this storage type is intended for recently
  received and verified blocks.
- **Scope**: The `Files Recent Persistence` will accept verified blocks through
  the node's messaging system and will store them under its root.
  The `Files Recent Persistence` will keep a limited number of blocks in its
  root path and will then proceed to delete the oldest blocks (rolling history).
  That is the full scope of the `Files Recent Persistence`. While the blocks are
  stored and available, they can be queried by other components of the system.
- **Persistence Results**: `Files Recent Persistence` publishes persistence
  results to the node's messaging system. These results will be pushed to
  subscribed handlers.

## Test Scenarios

> _**NOTE**: for the purpose of the below test definitions, we will have the
> following root definition (this could be configured to be different, but
> whatever is configured is of no relevance to the outcome of the tests, simply
> we need a reference point so an example could be shown):_
> - `Files Recent Root`: `/blocks`
>
> _**NOTE**: the trie structure for `Files Recent Root` is resolving
> all the digits of a `long` (max. 19 digits). We have three digits per node
> or directory up to a max. depth of 16, and then we have the full
> blockNumber (`long`) as the file name of any persisted block with all leading
> zeros. So for example, if the blockNumber is 1234567890123456789 and the root
> is `/blocks` then the path will be
> `/blocks/123/456/789/012/345/6/1234567890123456789.blk.zstd`._
>
> _**NOTE**: assume that before each test the Block-Node under test is expecting
> the next block to be received to be with number 0000000000001234567 which
> resolves to `/blocks/000/000/000/000/123/4/0000000000001234567.blk.zstd`. This
> is enough to illustrate the path resolution logic as well. Also, assume that
> the block is valid, has content and will successfully pass verification.
> Finally, assume that the above-mentioned block is NOT persisted before the
> start of each test._
>
> _**NOTE**: assume that we have a working verification because the
> `Files Recent Persistence` relies on blocks to be verified in order to execute
> any logic._
>
> _**NOTE**: assume that the Block-Node under test is configured to have the
> compression algorithm set to `ZStandard` so the file extension for a persisted
> block will be `.blk.zstd`_

#### E2ETC_HP_FRP_0005

##### Test Name

`Verify Persisted Block File can be Overwritten`

##### Scenario Description

`Files Recent Persistence` will persist a block after it has been received and
verified. If the received and verified block's resolved path already exists,
no matter what the reason is, it must be overwritten with the received block's
data. An Acknowledged block is deemed final and immutable (especially when the
next block is received, verified, persisted and acknowledged), but that is
outside the scope of the `Files Recent Persistence`. As long as data comes in to
the`Files Recent Persistence` it will be persisted at the resolved path. The
`Files Recent Persistence` is not a decision maker, it simply persists all data
it receives.

##### Requirements

The `Files Recent Persistence` is required to persist blocks. If a file is
present at the resolved location of the block, it is required to be truncated
and overwritten with the received data. The `Files Recent Persistence` is not
a decision maker, it is simply required to persists all data it receives.

##### Expected Behaviour

- It is expected that when the Block-Node receives the next in sequence block
  and then verifies it, the `Files Recent Persistence` will attempt to persist
  it at the resolved path.
- If a file already exists at that path, it will be truncated and overwritten
  with the received data.

##### Preconditions

- A publisher that is able to stream to the Block-Node under test.
- A regular file exists at the resolved location of the block under test with
  some arbitrary test data.
- A client that can call the public API to read the block (i.e. `getBlock`).

##### Input

- Valid block `0000000000001234567` is streamed as items, waiting for
  Acknowledgement (ensure it is persisted).

##### Output

- Regular Readable File:
  `/blocks/000/000/000/000/123/4/0000000000001234567.blk.zstd` exists.
- The file's binary content is the same as the binary data received via the
  stream
- A client is able to read the persisted block through the public
  API (i.e. `getBlock`).

##### Test Name

`Verify Persisted Block in Rapid Succession`

##### Scenario Description

`Files Recent Persistence` will persist a block after it has been received and
verified.

##### Requirements

The `Files Recent Persistence` is required to persist blocks.
The `Files Recent Persistence` is required to be able to persist blocks in rapid
succession with no apparent issues.

##### Expected Behaviour

- It is expected that a regular file is written at the properly resolved
  location for each block streamed.
- It is expected that an Acknowledgement is returned to the publisher for each
  block streamed when everything is successful.

##### Preconditions

- A publisher that is able to stream to the Block-Node under test.

##### Input

- Valid blocks `0000000000001234000` to `0000000000001235000` are rapidly
  streamed as items.

##### Output

- Regular Readable Files:
  `/blocks/000/000/000/000/123/4/0000000000001234000.blk.zstd` to
  `/blocks/000/000/000/000/123/5/0000000000001235000.blk.zstd` exist.
- These files have the same binary content as the original sent blocks.
- The persisted blocks are discoverable through public API calls.
- The persisted blocks are readable through public API calls.

##### Scenario Description

`Files Recent Persistence` will persist a block after it has been received and

##### Requirements

The `Files Recent Persistence` is required to persist blocks. If an IO failure
occurs during the write process, the Block-Node is required to return an
EndOfStream with PERSISTENCE_FAILED to the publisher.

`Verify Persisted Block File Cleanup on IO Failure`

##### Scenario Description

`Files Recent Persistence` will persist a block after it has been received and
verified.

##### Requirements

The `Files Recent Persistence` is required to persist blocks. If an IO failure
occurs during the write process, the `Files Recent Persistence` is required
to ensure that no files or data related to the current block are left on the
filesystem.

  if an IO failure occurs during write.
- No files or data related to the current block must be present after such
  failure.

##### Preconditions

- A publisher that is able to stream to the Block-Node under test.
- A way to simulate an IO issue for the resolved block.

##### Input

- Valid block `0000000000001234567` is streamed as items.
