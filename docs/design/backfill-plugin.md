## Purpose

This plugin purpose is to detect missing gaps in the intended stored block sequence, then autonomously and asynchronously fetch the missing blocks from another source and store them.

## Goals

1. Detect gaps on start-up an while running.
2. Fetch missing blocks from another BN, most be configurable.
3. Asynchronously recovery (fetch and store) the missing blocks, without blocking the live ingestion path (new coming blocks).
4. Instrumentation, logging, metrics and error handling for the backfill process.

## Entities

### BackfillPlugin

- The main plugin that manages the backfill process.
- Orchestrates runs, gap detection, fetching, and message processing.
- Handles configuration and initialization.
- Implements the `Block Node Plugin` interface.

### MessagingFacility

Block Node's messaging system used for communication between plugins and components.

### HistoricalBlockFacility

A facility that provides access to historical blocks, this is available for all plugins.

## Design

There are two flows for backfilling, Autonomous and On-Demand.

### Autonomous Backfill
The plugin will autonomously detect gaps in the block range and fetch missing blocks from a configured source.

1. At start-up a loop is defined that runs every `backfill.scanInterval`
2. At every interval the plugin detects missing gaps in the intended block range against the actual stored blocks using the `HistoricalBlockFacility`.
3. If gaps are found, it initiates the backfill process.
4. The plugin uses a gRPC client to connect to another Block Node (configured via `backfill_sources`) to fetch the missing blocks.
5. Once the blocks are fetched, the plugin creates a `BlockNotification` of type `BackfilledBlockNotification` and sends it to the `MessagingFacility`.
6. The `VerificationPlugin` will then process the `BackfilledBlockNotification` and if the block is valid, it will create a `VerificationNotification` and send it to the `MessagingFacility` for further processing.
7. The PersistencePlugin will then store the block in the local storage.
8. The `BackfillPlugin` will receive the `PersistenceNotification` and update its internal state accordingly, marking the backfill process as complete for that block.

    autonumber
    participant BackfillPlugin
    participant HistoricalBlockFacility
    participant GrpcClient
    participant MessagingFacility
    participant VerificationPlugin
    participant PersistencePlugin

    loop Every backfill.scanInterval
        BackfillPlugin->>HistoricalBlockFacility: detectMissingGaps(firstBlock, lastBlock)
        alt Gaps found
            BackfillPlugin->>+GrpcClient: fetchMissingBlocks(gapRange, batchSize)
            GrpcClient-->>-BackfillPlugin: blocks[]
            loop For each block
                BackfillPlugin->>MessagingFacility: BackfilledBlockNotification(block)
            end
        else No gaps
            Note right of BackfillPlugin: nothing to backfill
        end
    end

%% Verification path
    MessagingFacility->>VerificationPlugin: BackfilledBlockNotification(block)
    activate VerificationPlugin
    VerificationPlugin-->>MessagingFacility: VerificationNotification(block, valid)
    deactivate VerificationPlugin

%% Persistence path
    MessagingFacility->>PersistencePlugin: VerificationNotification(block, valid)
    activate PersistencePlugin
    PersistencePlugin-->>MessagingFacility: PersistenceNotification(block)
    deactivate PersistencePlugin

%% Backfill completion
    MessagingFacility->>BackfillPlugin: PersistenceNotification(block)
    activate BackfillPlugin
    BackfillPlugin-->>BackfillPlugin: markGapAsFilled(block)
    deactivate BackfillPlugin

```

### On-Demand Backfill
The plugin can also be triggered on-demand to backfill missing blocks when the latest block known to the network is received.

1. The plugin can also be triggered on-demand by sending a `NewestBlockKnownToNetwork` message to the `MessagingFacility`, usually this would be done by the `PublisherPlugin` or any other plugin that knows the latest block.
2. BackfillPlugin will handle the `NewestBlockKnownToNetwork` message and will check if there are any gaps in the block range available in the local storage.
3. If gaps are found, it will initiate the backfill process as described in the Autonomous Backfill section.
4. The process will be the same as the Autonomous Backfill, but it will be triggered by the `NewestBlockKnownToNetwork` message instead of the periodic scan.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant PublisherPlugin
    participant MessagingFacility
    participant BackfillPlugin
    participant HistoricalBlockFacility
    participant GrpcClient

    %% Trigger
    PublisherPlugin->>MessagingFacility: NewestBlockKnownToNetwork(latestBlock)

    %% Dispatch to backfill
    MessagingFacility->>BackfillPlugin: NewestBlockKnownToNetwork(latestBlock)
    BackfillPlugin->>HistoricalBlockFacility: detectMissingGaps(…, latestBlock)

    alt Gaps found
        BackfillPlugin->>GrpcClient: fetchMissingBlocks(gapRange, batchSize)
        GrpcClient-->>BackfillPlugin: blocks[]
        BackfillPlugin->>MessagingFacility: BackfilledBlockNotification(blocks)
    else No gaps
        BackfillPlugin-->>MessagingFacility: no gaps → no action
    end

```

### gRPC Client
The gRPC client is used to connect to another Block Node to fetch the missing blocks. It will be configured with the `backfill_sources` parameter, which is a list of HOST:PORT pairs of the Block Nodes to connect to.
- Fetching blocks will be done in batches, the size of which can be configured with the `backfill.fetchBatchSize` parameter.
- For each BN configured, the client will perform an `BlockNodeService/serverStatus` call to check if the missing gap is available in the remote BN, if it is not available, it will skip that BN and continue with the next one.
- If the remote BN is not available, it will log an error and continue with the next one.
- If the BN has the missing blocks, it will fetch them in batches using the `BlockStreamSubscribeService/subscribeBlockStream`
- If none of the configured BNs have the missing blocks, it will log an error and continue with the next iteration after the configured interval.

| `backfill.fetchBatchSize`      | Number of blocks to fetch in a single gRPC call                                       | 100     |


## Metrics

| Metric                    | Description                                                          | Type    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `backfill_gaps_detected`  | Number of gaps detected during the backfill process.                 | Counter |
| `backfill_blocks_fetched` | Number of blocks fetched during the backfill process.                | Counter |
| `backfill_blocks_stored`  | Number of blocks successfully stored in the local storage.           | Counter |
| `backfill_fetch_errors`   | Number of errors encountered while fetching blocks.                  | Counter |
| `backfill_status`         | Current status of the backfill process (e.g., idle, running, error). | Gauge   |
| `backfill_queue_size`     | Current amount of blocks pending to be backfilled.                   | Gauge   |


## Exceptions

Since the whole process is asynchronous, the plugin will not throw exceptions directly, but will log errors and retry fetching blocks based on the configuration, after a certain number of retries it will log the error and continue the next iteration after the configured interval.

## Acceptance Tests

- **Test 1:** Verify that the plugin detects gaps correctly on start-up. (initial backfill)
  - We need 2 BNs, one with a full block range.
  - Start a BN with a missing block range.
  - Verify that the plugin detects the missing blocks and initiates the backfill process using the configured BN1 as the source.
- **Test 2:** Verify that the plugin detects gaps while running. (ongoing backfill)
  - Start two BNs with a full block range.
  - While the BNs is running, remove some blocks from the local storage of the second BN.
  - Verify that the plugin detects the missing blocks and initiates the backfill process using the configured BN1 as the source.
