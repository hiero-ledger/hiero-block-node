# Distributed topology: 7 Consensus Nodes, 3 Block Nodes, 1 Mirror Node
#
# Consensus Nodes are grouped and stream to their designated Block Node:
#   - CN 1, 2, 3 stream to BN 1 (primary)
#   - CN 4, 5 stream to BN 2 (primary)
#   - CN 6, 7 stream to BN 3 (primary)
#
# Block Nodes backfill from each other for redundancy.
# Mirror Node subscribes to all Block Nodes.
#
# CN1,2,3 → BN1; CN4,5 → BN2; CN6,7 → BN3
# BN1 ↔ BN2 ↔ BN3 (backfill mesh)
# MN ← BN1, BN2, BN3
