# 2 Consensus Nodes, 2 Block Nodes with bidirectional backfill
#
# Each Consensus Node streams to its corresponding Block Node (CN1->BN1, CN2->BN2).
# Block Nodes peer with each other for backfill.
# Used for testing node replacement and backfill scenarios.
#
# CN1 → BN1 (primary); CN2 → BN2 (primary)
# BN1 ↔ BN2 (backfill)
# MN ← BN1, BN2
#
# NOTE: grpc_tuning.max_frame_size is set to 8MB to match server.http2.maxFrameSize and handle larger blocks.
# This can be removed once Block Node v0.27+ is released, as the default
# will be increased from 2MB to 8MB.
