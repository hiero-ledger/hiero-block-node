# Fan-out topology: 3 Consensus Nodes, 2 Block Nodes, 1 Mirror Node
#
# All Consensus Nodes can stream to all Block Nodes (fan-out pattern).
# This configuration tests redundancy and failover scenarios where
# Block Nodes can receive blocks from multiple sources.
# Block Nodes are peers of each other for gossip.
#
# CN1,2,3 → BN1 and BN2 (all CNs to both BNs)
# BN1 ↔ BN2 (backfill)
# MN ← BN1, BN2
