# Full History Backfill Test (Issue #1712)
#
# Tests that a block node can recover via greedy backfill from a peer
# after losing all local data.
#
# Scenario:
#   1. Verify BN1 and BN2 are receiving blocks
#   2. Clear all block storage on BN1 (simulate data loss)
#   3. Scale down BN1
#   4. Wait for gap to form (BN2 continues receiving from CN2)
#   5. Scale up BN1
#   6. Verify BN1 backfills all historical blocks from BN2
#   7. Verify BN1 resumes receiving live blocks
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Topology "2cn-2bn-backfill" deployed (BN1 and BN2 with mutual backfill)
#
# Usage:
#   task test:run TEST_FILE=tests/full-history-backfill.yaml TOPOLOGY=2cn-2bn-backfill
