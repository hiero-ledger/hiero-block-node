# Node Restart Resilience Test
#
# Validates that all Block Nodes recover correctly after one is restarted.
# Tests resilience, data integrity, and backfill capability.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Any topology deployed (task up)
#   - Port forwards active (task port-forward)
#
# Usage:
#   task test:run TEST_FILE=tests/node-restart-resilience.yaml
