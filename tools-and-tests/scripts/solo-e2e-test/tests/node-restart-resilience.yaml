# Node Restart Resilience Test
#
# Validates that the Block Node recovers correctly after a restart
# during active load generation. Tests resilience and data integrity.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Topology "single" deployed (task up)
#   - Port forwards active (task port-forward)
#
# Usage:
#   task test:run TEST_FILE=tests/node-restart-resilience.yaml
